        <p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The
        fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
        to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
        searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. This
        projected audience is one hundred million readers. If our value
        per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
        million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
        files per month: thus upping our productivity from one million.
        The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
        Files by the December 31, 2001. [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
        This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
        which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
        of the year 2001.</p>
